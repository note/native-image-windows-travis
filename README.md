The objective of that project is to present example of build definition for Windows environment on Travis CI.

For readability purposes it contains only build for Windows. If you're interested in how build for MacOS, Linux and Windows look like take a look at e.g. [teleport-scala](https://github.com/note/teleport-scala).

Releases are triggered by pushing tags in certain format (e.g. `v0.1.0`).
